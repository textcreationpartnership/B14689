            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>Thus falles it out with a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of good wittes, who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their great paynes to bee slenderly regarded, and their long lingred hopes in the end quite frustrated: are compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to harder extremities then fitteth their deserts, or stands with the credit of such thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse men to suffer them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Can not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend this book to any fauorite of this worlde, because it will prooue too vnsauorie for his taste, and to wishe it to one that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiseth the worlde, being ignoraunt of his abode, I know not how to sende it him▪ therefore in so hard a case this wilbe most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for mee, to let it passe along with what suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse shall please God to
<pb facs="tcp:176742:6"/> send it, for he will giue his blessing to euery good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour.</p>
            <p>Concerning the title which is giuen to the booke, it may bee carpt at by some, and misconstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by others, as if this poor man did imagine himselfe onely to be deuout, or that none but he were acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the rules of deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But thus he answers for himselfe: He tearmes it not the Deuoute mans Purposes, in any respect of his owne singularitie, or that he is, or easily can bee so mortified from this worlde, as these seuerall Meditations doo instruct
<pb facs="tcp:176742:6"/> a man to bee: but he that will attaine to true deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion indeed, and frame his life as becommeth a good christian, he must (in his opinion) lay holde vppon these purposes, as also ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely to practise them in his dayly conuersation, whereto God giuing the holy assistance of his spirit, and enabling him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede on in these religious determinations: that then they may iustly be called a deuout mans purposes, &amp; no man can so purpose, but he will bee deuout in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede.</p>
            <p>And thus yee haue this poore mans plaine mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb facs="tcp:176742:7"/> farre from proude conceite of himselfe, or misdeeming of others.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:176742:12"/> or no. How worthy then art thou of most sharpe reprehension, for laying such fast hold on this false and slippery worlde, as if thou wert to remayne here for euer? Thus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny build houses, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer stay to dwell in them, and while the swifte houre of death coms stealing on, they make but a ieste of sounde approued trueth, thinking they runne away with a riche robbery of worldly vanities. Why doth the traueller beare so patiently a badde nightes lodging in his Inne, but that hee hopes to sleepe at better quiet y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> next night in his own house? This one consideration (me thinkes) might suffice to make
<pb facs="tcp:176742:13"/> thee patiently endure all the turmoils and troubles of this life, remembring how short a while they wil last, and forthwith thou must returne to thine own house in heauē, where thou shalt repose thy self quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for euer.</p>

                  <hi>but not in distresse, wee are in pouertie, but want not: wee are cast down, but we perish not:</hi> I say wee want not, because our tribulatiō (for the present time) is but short &amp; momē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, if wee liue not contē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating those things which we see, but those w<seg rend="sup">c</seg> we see not. Thus was the Apostle Paule enforced hereto, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the breuitie of present tribulation, &amp; that he iourneyed to arriue at the heauenly Citty. If hee
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:176742:14"/> was such a pilgrim, let not like trauell seem laborious to thee: If when thou iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyest it fall out irksome to thee, and that men thinke scorne to knowe thee, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it not to bee vile or molestious, because thy trauel wil soone be ended.</p>
               <p>S. Paule speaking of the Saintes of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, saith: <hi>That they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed themselues to be stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers &amp; pilgrims on the earth.</hi>

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the seruantes of this worlde, troubled about base and slender matters, giue no attention to the great and higher: so that by trifling about bodily businesse, they want time to thinke on the affaires of the soule. Hence is it, that fruitles thoughtes are the children of riches, and the works they bring with them, doo nothing els but choake and confound the spirite. Therefore thou shalt do well in making no

               <p>From hence it proceedeth that the wisedome of God, and this other of the world are so contrary: for as the one is despised by him, so is the other condemned by men, and thus they that haue no iudgement at all, bande their wits against the Lorde of all knowledge and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Balaam, albeit he was a wicked man, (the holy Ghost making him the instrument) spake by his mouth, when hee sawe the tents, &amp; fields of the people of Israel:<note place="margin">Num. 24.</note>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:176742:37"/> Balaam spake this, fortie yeares were ouerpast since the people of Israel went out of Egipte, and then their tents must needes bee very olde. Hereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that the world ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer prayseth but by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward beautie, and exteriour paintinges: whereas God respecteth the inwarde one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and what to the worlde seemes poore or opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, is by God commended and exalted to the cloudes.</p>
               <p>He that hath a plaint be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a learned man, that hath skill and knowes the course of iustice, neuer great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly cares to bee condemned by an ignorāt iudge, because hee can recall it before this man more learned, whose sē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is indeed worthy to be
<pb facs="tcp:176742:38"/> regarded. Iudges are many times worldly men, respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of profite, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous persons are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time tryed before them by men of slender estimation: where they are accounted but as fooles, and so all their life time must they beare this sentence, till they come before him better learned, who will doo them better iustice. Euen so princes of this worlde haue reckoned holy Martyrs to bee fooles, seeing with what prompt will they gaue themselues to death: And many wise worldlings haue held euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall pouertie for foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, tearming them all fools and beggers that followed Christ Iesus.</p>
               <p>A wise man of the world

And this is the censure which the worlde giues of good men, that they are ignorant and knowe nothing, but when this case shall bee tryed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the great learned iudge which is God himself, then it wil fall out otherwise, hee will condemne the worldes

Then let it not offend thee, if the worlde condemne thy life, seeing thou hast such a iudge to appeale vnto, and who will speedily giue thee comfort. Moreouer, the day wil not be long ere it come, when this high &amp; supreame Iusticer will approue that which the world reprou'd, &amp; the most curious contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued policy, wil appear to be but bare &amp; tottered folly, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen they that by wit labour most to despoil others, shal like fooles be shaken out of their rags, &amp; sent away emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

               <p>In this Schole then hast thou to study both night &amp; day, there maiest thou learn to be truely mortified: and looke how much thou didst know in this vallie of mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, so much more shalt thou then be ignorant, and dead to this world.</p>
               <p>Iacob, after he had wrast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the Angel, remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned lame of one legge, and was called Israel,<note place="margin">Gen. 32.</note> to wit the man that saw and preuailed

<pb facs="tcp:176742:50"/> that a peece of clay, a mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable sinfull man, fraile, weake, subiect to all infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, should presume and make such boast of his strength, that cannot resist a poor worme from feeding on him in his graue: while this lustre gallant liueth hee is offended, nay conquered by many of these smal crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as flies that sting his face, and hee cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge it, Fleas that molest him in bed, and hee cannot helpe it, wormes that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure his entrailes, and hee cannot redresse it: now when hee lyes in his graue, wormes must eate him, and he cannot withstande it, for it is written, <hi>VVhen a man is dead, he is but food for worms and serpents.</hi> Where nowe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:176742:50"/> is this boaster of his strēgth? pull downe that loftie opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of thy valour, and say, that sufferaunce is the best staffe of thy strength.</p>
               <p>The lightning burneth and consumeth all thinges on the earth, excepte the Laurell tree, and that is no way hurt with the fires vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, no more then the iust man is in the fire of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation: true vertue then is that godly Laurell tree, which is alwaies greene and neuer hurt or impayred by any affliction.</p>
               <p>Nowe what is the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est pride of this strong mans strength? forsooth hee must pocket no wrong, endure no thwarting words, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, hee will reuenge his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries himselfe. There are
<pb facs="tcp:176742:51"/> three thinges which God onely reserueth to himselfe, and will haue no man be so bold as to meddle with any of them. The first, iudging the intention and thoughts of our neighbours, whereto his owne saying is agreable: <hi>Iudge not others,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 7</note>
                  <hi>and you shall not bee iudged:</hi> the Father hath giuen to the Sonne all power of iudgement. The second,<note place="margin">Esay. 48.</note> is honor and glory conformable to his own say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>To no one wil I giue my glory.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 32.</note> The third thing which he reserueth to himselfe, is vengeance, <hi>Ʋengeance is mine:</hi> let him then beware, that will take from him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of these three. Then more then meere foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is it to seeke reuenge, which alwayes bringeth
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:176742:51"/> with it y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> losse &amp; hurt of our neighbour, beside, it is great vanitie to heale his owne wound, with drawing blood of another, for a reuengeful man seekes his owne helpe by anothers harme, and to assure his owne health, by another mans infirmity: which (in briefe) is nothing else, then seeking water in fire, sweet grapes on thorns, and figges on thistles, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thinke thy selfe a very vayne man, and the matter altogether impossible for thee, by another mans griefe to allay thine owne anguish.</p>
               <p>Great folly is it beside, that a man will reuenge himselfe to his owne losse: for hee cannot doe the least harme to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
<pb facs="tcp:176742:52"/> bodie, but hee doeth much more to his own soul and conscience. It is written in the Prouerbs, <hi>Say not thou, I wil render euill for euil, but trust in the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 20.</note>
                  <hi>and hee will deliuer thee,</hi> from perill of body and soule in hel fire, whereof thou art assured to taste, if thou take the Lords office out of his hand. Stand not on thine owne defence, sayth the Apostle, but giue way to anger, not prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting lawfull defence of a mans owne self, but forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding reuenge, vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this place reuenge by the worde defence, as in the booke of Iudith it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that Nabuchadnezzar sware to defende himselfe against al nations,<note place="margin">Iudit. 1.</note> where the holy scripture vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:176742:52"/> by defending him self, reuenging himselfe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such as reuenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues on their enemies, fall into Gods reuenge, &amp; shall be punished as mightie sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Hath another man offended thee, and art thou angry at it? How often hast thou offended God and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer beene sory for it? if our pittifull God shold reuenge one weeks offences of thine, long since hadst thou beene where there is no redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Hearst thou not that what measure you mete to other,<note place="margin">Luk. 6.</note> the very same shall be mete to you agayne? and as yee handle others, so will God handle you?

               <p>Thus as the offēce is made God will haue the chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment answerable thereto, &amp; he y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> wil haue no compassion on his neighbour, God will deny compassion to him: thē reuenge thou thy self on thy neighbour, God will reuenge himselfe on thee, but if thou be benigne and mercifull to him, God wilbe much more

With iudgement we looke vppon a creature, by the knowledge of whose stature and beautie, we may come to the knowledge &amp; excellencie of the creator.

<pb facs="tcp:176742:57"/> for the beautie of all the creatures in the worlde, is not like one drop of water to the maine Sea, in respect of his incomparable beauty that made them, and this were more vanitie, then if thou shouldst fall in loue with thine owne fayrenesse. Tell mee one thing, doth not thy beautie proceede from thy soule? Take thy soule from the body, and all thy beautie hath soone lost his splendour, because the soule is that which giues life to the beautie of the body: then if thy body seem faire, so much the more oughtst thou to loue thy soul, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cause of thy bodies beauty. If the presēce of the soul, be y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> reason of thy fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, thou maiest firmly then

               <p>If we could beholde this beautie with our bodily eies, wee woulde despise all other beauty vnder hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: for so exceeding great is this beautie of the soule, that it is in grace and fauor with God.

<pb facs="tcp:176742:67"/> honor, reposing himselfe at pleasure in his pallace, then did hee offende most gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously: whereby wee may perceyue, that when men mount to loftie honours, then present perill attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on them. There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men lifted to honor, who to maintaine the good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit they haue thereof, will not feare to displease God, &amp; defame their neyghbour: yea rather then to repayre their neighbors fame again, with any vayling of their owne aspired promotion, they will aduenture body &amp; soule to the deuil, such is their affectiō to this worlds vain honor. <hi>Among the chief Rulers</hi> (saith S. Iohn) <hi>were many that beleeued in Christ:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 12.</note>
                  <hi>but because of the Phariseis
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:176742:67"/> they durst not confesse him, lest they shoulde bee cast out of the Sinagogue. For they loued the glory of men more then the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God.</hi> Such an estate (in mine opinion) is most la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable, when men are so ouercome with regarde of worldly honour, that they will rather loose their owne souls, then one inch of their height in this worlde. Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late condemned the Sauior of the whole world,<note place="margin">Mat. 17.</note> althogh hee knewe him to bee most innocent, yet hee must not loose a iotte of the honour wherein hee was installed. Full well did Pilate knowe, that through mallice and enuie they deliuered him vppe into his power, and though in outward shew he pretended and sought his

Thus the onely Lord of life must be sentenced to death, for feare of Caesars displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, all iniustice must bee committed, yea, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe highly wronged, rather then worldly pompe must be lost, or great mens fauor diminished.</p>

The like did Caiphas the high Priest, with those of his councell, concluding on Christes death, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of their owne au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities: neuer fearing the comming of the Romanes, who despoiled them of all the worldly dignities they had. If thou didst truly knowe in what hell of life they liue, who are preferred to worldly honours: most gladly wouldst thou hate such a vaine &amp; idle dreame, which bringes care and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestation, but nothing else that may be tearmed good.</p>
               <p>Hast thou not seene in some triumph or solemne showe, a statue or image of a

How curious is the deuiser in furnishing this Antique? of this freende borrowing a veluet gowne, of another a chaine of gold, &amp; so of diuers persons sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying his sundry necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? No sooner is the shew ended and the beholders gon, but the puppet is stript out of all his brauerie: and whereas he seemed goodly before, now stands he naked and of no account at all. No fitter comparison can bee made of this worlds honor, thē by this image or statue, for when a man is once pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest of that vaine-breathing word, &amp; while the shewe or
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:176742:69"/> enterlude of this life la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth: of the excrements of the poore silke worme hee borroweth his veluet gowne and braue apparell, of the earth it selfe his chaine of gold, and iewelles, so when the shewe is ended, that is, when life is once past ouer, his wretched carkasse lyes like that despoyled statue, robde of all his gaye attyre, and no more remembred, then as if it had neuer beene.</p>
               <p>When Adam was in so great honour in Paradise,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> then fell hee to sinne high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Contrariwise, after that Iob had beene buffeted with many tribulations, and afflictions,<note place="margin">Iob. 1.</note> euen to the meere losse of patience and offending of God, yet for

Hee that standes on a high tower, if his foote but slippe is in danger of a shrewd fall: so consequently in greater perill are they that stand on the bridges of loftie build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges, then they that sit in se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:176742:70"/> mightie men of this world, then in them that are poore and so deiected. Great men cōsume their time idlely, in sports and sensuall delights, liuing as they list, and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding delicately: which is more displeasing in the sight of God, thē the course of their life, who liue by their labour &amp; dayly sweat, therefore they that desire to liue eternally, abase them felues in this worlde, that they may be exalted in the world to come.</p>
               <p>The Merchant man that trauels for his dayly mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, buyes his wares at the best hande, where hee may haue most choyse, and selles deere afterwarde, to make his most benefite. If thou wouldst trauaile to

               <p>If thou come well proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of these commodities,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:176742:71"/> thou shalt bee a welcome man to that countrey, thy store will there encrease, &amp; thou wilt quickly be hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. But if thou labour in vayne, loading thy selfe with a fardle of follies, a huge heape of honors, and this worldes felicities: thou canst haue no landing there, there are none of thy minde to barter withall, not a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie profite canst thou make of all thy trumpery, trusse vppe and bee gonne, for there they will not knowe thee.

               <p>Of strange nature and very rare is this worldes friendshippe, euery one befriending himselfe espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, for if any one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare himselfe to bee thy friende, vsing ceremonies of kindnesse and affable protestations: hee doeth it but to serue his owne turne with thee, expecting some fauoure or benefite from thee, because thou art rich, and in the worlds high reputation. But if thou fall into decaye or want, he will be sure to bee the first that shall forsake thee: and they whom thou most of all diddest repose
<pb facs="tcp:176742:97"/> thy trust in, like trencher flies will be gonne, leauing thee like a blind man, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any staffe to leane vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, euen they who shewed themselues thy nearest and dearest friendes, here their loue and kindnesse makes their full period. Poore deceyued man, they beare no loue to thee but to the goodes and possessions thou hast, for all their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde diligence is but to profite themselues withall, not regarding thee for that thou art, but for that thou hast, and so long as thou shalt bee able to giue them, so long will they bee frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to thee.</p>

If among the blessinges and fauours, which God giues to his seruantes, there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen some small shew of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill and tribulation: yet they bring with them the benefit of thy soules health, which the other of this worlde do continually fight against: and hence proceeds it, that the weakenes of our nature is such, as Gods bountifull fauours are like bitter wormwood to vs, but those that this vaine life af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth, sweeter then hony, or any thing else whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.</p>
               <p>After that our Sauiour

So the spouse in the Canticles hearing her beloued praise her, as being <hi>the fayrest among women:</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:176742:116"/> forthwith she sayth: <hi>Shewe me (O thou) whome my soule loueth,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>To the Apostles Iames &amp; Ioh. he said, <hi>ye know not what ye aske, are ye able to drinke of the cuppe that I shall drink of?</hi> And to the Spouse: <hi>If thou know not, get thee forth by the stocke, and feede thy kiddes by the tentes of the shepheardes.</hi>

The purest wine gets soonest into the head: which makes a wise Lord or ruler of seruantes, when hee sees any of his followers seek to disorder themselues with drinking of the best wine, that they shall abate the strength thereof with water.

A man that is fauoured and estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, knowes not himselfe, but is knowen of many: whereas the disfauoured &amp; abiect person knowes what himselfe is, though hee bee regarded by no other.

               <p>God sendeth trouble &amp; afflictions to such as hee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, because they shoulde not busie their thoughtes with worldly occasions, but still bee labouring on their iourney towarde heauen. It comes to passe many times that a traueller, who in the sommer season hath a iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to some place or other, being ouer hot and sweatie, finding a shady place, where the grasse is pleasant, and the ayre very coole, sits downe there to rest himself, and delights so long in that idle recreation, that all the rest of his day-labour is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly lost. According to this similitude dealeth God
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:176742:121"/> with his chosen children, making the trauaile of this life seeme sweatie, painefull and laborious to them, that they should make the more haste to finish their iourney without loytring in the fresh aire and shaddowes of this world, and so loose the day light to go stumbling in the darke: For the Sunnes heate and toyling on the way discourageth not a wise traueller, or makes him slacke his pace, but to vse the more haste, and rest himselfe in his Inne, least being shut out by late com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thether, he lies in the street, &amp; haue none to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him.</p>
               <p>It is our Lords wil there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that to such as loue him, and seeke after his
<pb facs="tcp:176742:122"/> glory, the passage of this life shoulde bee full of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, trouble and molesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: least being deceyued with the worldes vayne al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurings, their eternal hopes might be altred, &amp; he loose them, whome hee maketh dearest account of. To draw the children of Israel out of Egypte,<note place="margin">Exod. 15,</note> and make them long and desire the more to see their promised coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: God permitted Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh so many wayes to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict them. When Iaacob was kindly vsed in Labans house, hee had no minde at all of his own countrey: but when hee perceyued Laban and his sonnes deale hardly with him, thē he called Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel &amp; Leah to him, saying: <hi>I will no longer tarry from the</hi>

               <p>The byrd neither abides or restes her selfe on the ground, but while the time of necessitie compelles her: the remaynder of her lyfe is imployed in mounting toward heauen.</p>
               <p>If then thou wilt escape from the perilles of this lyfe, thou must make no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byding on the earth, but

               <p>Make cleane then thy heart, washing all vayne sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude and worldly care out of it, that thou mayest with the more ease lifte it vp to God: for distraction of the hearte cooleth the heate of loue, bringing a man into many temptations and snares of the enemy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause nature and sensualitie are very mightie, &amp; they go seeking one another in the vanities and delights of this worlde, whereby the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding being darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the spirite wexeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible, and performes all spirituall and godly exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses with little taste or fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of any pleasure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>

Then wel may we say, that world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carke and care for exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or occasions (how lawful so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer) do but blind the sight of memory, and obscure the splendour of the true light indeed: Therefore, if thou wilt giue thy selfe wholly to God, thou must bee disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened of all worldly sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and abasing thy mind to these seruile vanities.</p>

Do we read in the scriptures, that God at

               <p>Trees which are planted or cutte in the full of the Moone, doe but engender wormes, loose their owne vertue, and perish: the like doeth excesse of eating or drinking, for when the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is full, it nothing but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth the worms of sine in the soule, consume the whole man, and cutting him off from God, makes him die &amp; wither in wickednes.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:176742:161"/> Our Sauiour in the Gospell compareth such men to trees, that are fit for nothing but the fire: And Dauid in the Psalmes saith, <hi>The iust man is like a tree planted by the Riuers side, a prospering tree and full of fruitfulnes.</hi> For as the walles of Babilon were ouerthrowne by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzer, euen so doth surfeyting by meat or drink destroy all the vertues aby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the soule.
